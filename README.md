# Krishi-Sakha

This project was created during the contest of Astrathon 1.0, We here have created an app that lets farmer choose a good crop according to the condition of thier land. So, based on distinct factors like land condition, soil fertility and pH levels, we suggest the best suited crop for that land. We have create a deep neural network that connects to web via django. We can input all the neccessary fields required to get the best suited crop for that part of the land.
